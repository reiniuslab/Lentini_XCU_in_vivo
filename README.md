## Abstract
Mammalian X-chromosome dosage balance is regulated by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and X-chromosome upregulation (XCU), but the dynamics of XCU as well as the interplay between the two mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we mapped XCU throughout early mouse embryonic development at cellular and allelic resolution, revealing sex- and lineage-specific dynamics along key events in X-chromosome regulation. Our data show that XCU is linearly proportional to the degree of XCI, indicating that dosage compensation ensues based on mRNA levels rather than number of active X chromosomes. In line with this, we reveal that the two active X chromosomes in female naïve embryonic stem cells are not hyperactive as previously thought. In all lineages, XCU was underlain by increased transcriptional burst frequencies, providing a mechanistic basis in vivo. Together, our results demonstrate unappreciated flexibility of XCU in balancing X-chromosome expression, and we propose a general model for allelic dosage balance, applicable for wider mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.
